The Win32::Girder::IEvent modules allow access to the Girder Internet Events
API. Girder is an application use for Windows automation, originally designed
for use with IR remote controls. However it is now possible to control Girder
via TCP IP.

Note that this module is not Win32 specific. It designed to talk to an 
application running on Win32 but the module itself should run on any platform
that supports perl 5.6.0 with the 'select()' function. The tests also require
'fork()'.
